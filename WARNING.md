Only informed users or trainers should apply this system in practice and must review all generated outputs. These stories illustrate everyday behavioral situations and are intended primarily for conceptual and linguistic modeling within the SN/DE framework. Any use in practice or (self) advisory contexts requires independent validation by qualified experts. Users should verify any factual information through official or peer-reviewed sources, preferably recent publications in relevant scientific fields. Large language models remain prone to hallucinations, and this version of the package does not include automatic guideline or source-credibility verification.
